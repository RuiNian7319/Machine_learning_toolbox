## This repository contains some common machine learning methods <br>

Many methods here are available in scikit-learn and other packages, however, those packages are "unobservable" at times so I made my own. <br>

Important_features: Used to identify features that have weights above a threshold.  Used to identify high importance features in small scale ML models such as logistic regression and OLS <br>
k_folds:  Does k-fold division of training and test data.  Used to test different training and testing data's effect on overall model performance. <br>
